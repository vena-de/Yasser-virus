# Yasser-virus
A totally (not real!) unique virus that kills the explorer process and shows an image of yasserprogamer.

(keep in mind this was made as a joke and is not targetting yasserprogamer or anyone.)

P.S: I seem to be getting ignored in a screenshare while trying to show off my cool (not real) virus and I feel like I should just deactivate everything now. I don't deserve to have my stuff looked at. I am just an idiot trying to seek attention.
